        // - the data that is permanent (accountControllers and accountCollaterals from the EthereumVaultConnector
        // contract)

        // for the permanent data, there's no need to care that much about optimizations. each account has its two sets.
        // usually, an address inserted to either of them won't be removed within the same transaction. the only
        // optimization applied (directly in the Set contract) is that on the first element insertion, the stamp is set
        // to non-zero value to always keep that storage slot in non-zero state. it allows for cheaper SSTORE when an
        // element is inserted again after clearing the set.

        // for the transient data, an address insertion should be as cheap as possible. hence on construction, we store
        // dummy values for all the storage slots where the elements will be stored later on. it is important
        // considering that both accountStatusChecks and vaultStatusChecks are always cleared at the end of the
        // transaction. with dummy values set, the transition from zero to non-zero and back to zero will be
        // significantly cheaper than it would be otherwise
