# Ethereum Vault Connector

The Ethereum Vault Connector (EVC) is a foundational layer designed to facilitate the core functionality required for a lending market. It serves as a base building block for various protocols, providing a robust and flexible framework for developers to build upon. The EVC primarily mediates between vaults, contracts that implement the [ERC-4626](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-4626/) interface and contain additional logic for interfacing with other vaults. The EVC not only provides a common base ecosystem but also reduces complexity in the core lending/borrowing contracts, allowing them to focus on their differentiating factors.

For more information, visit the EVC [website](https://evc.wtf/) or refer to the [whitepaper](https://github.com/euler-xyz/ethereum-vault-connector/tree/master/docs/whitepaper.md) and the [specs](https://github.com/euler-xyz/ethereum-vault-connector/tree/master/docs/specs.md).

## Install

To install Ethereum Vault Connector in a [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) project:

```sh
forge install euler-xyz/ethereum-vault-connector
```

## Usage

The Ethereum Vault Connector comes with a comprehensive set of tests written in Solidity, which can be executed using Foundry.

For a detailed understanding of the Ethereum Vault Connector and considerations for its integration, please refer to the [EVC website](https://evc.wtf/), the [whitepaper](https://github.com/euler-xyz/ethereum-vault-connector/tree/master/docs/whitepaper.md) and the [specs](https://github.com/euler-xyz/ethereum-vault-connector/tree/master/docs/specs.md). You can find examples of vaults utilizing the Ethereum Vault Connector in the [EVC Playground](https://github.com/euler-xyz/evc-playground/tree/master/src) repository. However, these example vaults are not meant for production use as they have not been audited and are intended solely for testing and experimentation purposes.

To install Foundry:

```sh
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

This will download foundryup. To start Foundry, run:

```sh
foundryup
```

To clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/euler-xyz/ethereum-vault-connector.git && cd ethereum-vault-connector
```

## Testing

### in `default` mode

To run the tests in a `default` mode:

```sh
forge test
```

### with `scribble` annotations

To run the tests using `scribble` annotations first install [scribble](https://docs.scribble.codes/):

```sh
npm install -g eth-scribble
```

To instrument the contracts and run the tests:

```sh
scribble test/evc/EthereumVaultConnectorScribble.sol --output-mode files --arm && forge test
```

To remove instrumentation:

```sh
scribble test/evc/EthereumVaultConnectorScribble.sol --disarm
```

### in `coverage` mode

```sh
forge coverage
```
